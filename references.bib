	abstract = {Perceiving the surroundings accurately and quickly is one of the most essential and challenging tasks for autonomous systems such as self-driving cars. The most common sensing systems such as RADAR and LIDAR that are used for perception on self-driving cars today give a full 360◦ view to the car making it more informed about the environment than a human driver. This article presents a methodology to employ two 360◦ cameras to perceive obstacles all around the autonomous vehicle using stereo vision. Using vertical, rather than horizontal, camera displacement allows the computation of depth information in all viewing directions, except zenith and nadir which have the least useful information about the obstacles. The Key idea for obstacle detection is to classify points in the 3D space based on height, width and traversable slope relative to the neighbouring points. The detected obstacle points can be mapped onto convenient projection planes for motion planning.},

	abstract = {Robots with many degrees of freedom (e.g., humanoid robots and mobile manipulators) have increasingly been employed to accomplish realistic tasks in domains such as disaster relief, spacecraft logistics, and home caretaking. Finding feasible motions for these robots autonomously is essential for their operation. Sampling-based motion planning algorithms have been shown to be eﬀective for these high-dimensional systems. However, incorporating task constraints (e.g., keeping a cup level, writing on a board) into the planning process introduces signiﬁcant challenges. This survey describes the families of methods for sampling-based planning with constraints and places them on a spectrum delineated by their complexity. Constrained sampling-based methods are based upon two core primitive operations: () sampling constraint-satisfying conﬁgurations and () generating constraintsatisfying continuous motion. Although the basics of samplingbased planning are presented for contextual background, the survey focuses on the representation of constraints and samplingbased planners that incorporate constraints.},

The visual feature is encoded with BRAND (binary robust appearance and normals descriptor), which efficiently combines appearance and geometric shape information from RGB-D images. Furthermore, the feature descriptors are stored using the Locality-Sensitive-Hashing (LSH) technique and hierarchical clustering trees are used to search for these binary features. Finally, the algorithm for matching of multi feature points using local geometric constraints is provided, which can effectively reject the possible false closure hypotheses.

It has a significant advantage over dynamic environment compared to other algorithms. In this paper, a Deep-Sarsa model is trained in a grid environment and then deployed in an environment in ROS-Gazebo for UAVs. The experimental results show that the trained Deep-Sarsa model can guide the UAVs to the target without any collisions.

	abstract = {RRT* is a computationally efficient algorithm due to the random generation of nodes and it converges towards the optimal path after a collision-free path is found. Unlike other planning algorithms, this property of RRT* allows the robot to start moving in a trajectory almost immediately and then improves the path as it moves towards the goal. Therefore, RRT* is a powerful yet simple algorithm used for navigation. RRT* is implemented on Turtlebot 3 to traverse some static obstacles within the workspace. The map is generated with the SLAM algorithm, which is part of the gmapping library in ROS. The path is first generated from the RRT* and inverse kinematics to move from one node to another is calculated and published in sequence to the robot with Robot Operating System (ROS). The localization library from the AMCL package in ROS is used to as a controller for the robot to ensure it moves to the right position. The results obtained using the proposed RRT* are compared to the results of the available ROS libraries, proving that the proposed RRT* algorithm is promising.},

CBiRRT extends the Bi-directional RRT (BiRRT) algorithm by using projection techniques to explore the conﬁguration space manifolds that correspond to constraints and to ﬁnd bridges between them. Consequently, CBiRRT can solve many problems that the BiRRT cannot, and only requires one additional parameter: the allowable error for meeting a constraint.

While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

We assume that overall research and development will accelerate by using a common robot platform among a lot of researchers since that enables them to share their research results. Therefore we have developed a compact and safe research platform, Human Support Robot (HSR), which can be operated in an actual home environment and we have provided it to various research institutes to establish the developers community. Currently, the number of HSR users is expanding to 44 sites in 12 countries worldwide (as of November 30th, 2018). To activate the community, we assume that the robot competition will be effective. As a result of international public offering, HSR has been adopted as a standard platform for international robot competitions such as RoboCup@Home and World Robot Summit (WRS). HSR is provided to participants of those competitions. In this paper, we describe HSR’s development background since 2006, and technical detail of hardware design and software architecture. Specifically, we describe its omnidirectional mobile base using the dual-wheel caster-drive mechanism, which is the basis of HSR’s operational movement and a novel whole body motion control system. Finally, we describe the verification of autonomous task capability and the results of utilization in RoboCup@Home in order to demonstrate the effect of introducing the platform.},

A drive mechanism equips with a couple of standard wheels in a differential-drive manner driven by two independent motors. A steering joint, driven by the third motor; is mounted on the differential drive mechanism at a location off-centeredfiom a mid-point of the two wheels. Thus, the drive mechanism has a dualwheel-caster configuration.A vehicleframe is attached on the top of the steering shaft with its center locating on the center of the shaj?. The three independent motors, driving the wheels and the steering, allow the mobile base to exhibit holonomic and omnidirectional motions with no over constraint. First the concept of the original caster drive will be mentioned brieflx followed by kinematic analysis of the dual-wheel-castermechanism. A prototype vehicle is designed, built and its mobility has been tested. However basic holonomic motion has been successful(y performed by the prototype, practical problems have been revealed because of casters on the vehicleframe. To solve those problems, another possible variation for the fiture vehicle design with a traditional synchro-drive mechanism is proposed. The kinematics and statics of the drive mechanism are also analyzed. All wheel driving without over constraint, decoupled control, and eflcient driving would be achieved with the proposed synchro-drive.},

The trees each explore space around them and also advance towards each other through the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan motions for a human arm (modeled as a 7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 3D, and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3D workspace.

Recently, a variant of RRT called RRT* has been proposed that ensures asymptotic optimality. Subsequently its bidirectional version has also been introduced in the literature known as Bidirectional-RRT* (B-RRT*). We introduce a new variant called Intelligent Bidirectional-RRT* (IB-RRT*) which is an improved variant of the optimal RRT* and bidirectional version of RRT* (B-RRT*) algorithms and is specially designed for complex cluttered environments. IB-RRT* utilizes the bidirectional trees approach and introduces intelligent sample insertion heuristic for fast convergence to the optimal path solution using uniform sampling heuristics. The proposed algorithm is evaluated theoretically and experimental results are presented that compares IB-RRT* with RRT* and B-RRT*. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate the superior efficiency of IB-RRT* in comparison with RRT* and B-RRT in complex cluttered environments.},

TSRs can deﬁne acceptable goal poses of an end-effector or constraints on the end-effector’s pose during the path, or both. First presented as a method for goal-speciﬁcation [1], TSRs are a straightforward representation of sets of end-effector poses which can be sampled and which entail a clear distance metric. This makes TSRs ideal for sampling-based motion planning. However, a ﬁnite set of TSRs is sometimes insufﬁcient to capture the pose constraints of a given task. To describe more complex constraints, we present TSR Chains, which are deﬁned by linking a series of TSRs. Though the sampling for TSR Chains follows clearly from that of TSRs, the distance metric for TSR Chains is radically different. We also present a new version of our Constrained Bidirectional RRT (CBiRRT2) planner, which is capable of planning with TSR chains as well as other constraints. We demonstrate our approach on the HRP3 robot by performing a variety of whole-body manipulation tasks.},

	title = {Whole-body motion planning for manipulation of articulated objects},
	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2013.6630792},
	abstract = {Humanoid service robots performing complex object manipulation tasks need to plan whole-body motions that satisfy a variety of constraints: The robot must keep its balance, self-collisions and collisions with obstacles in the environment must be avoided and, if applicable, the trajectory of the end-effector must follow the constrained motion of a manipulated object in Cartesian space. These constraints and the high number of degrees of freedom make whole-body motion planning for humanoids a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an approach to whole-body motion planning with a focus on the manipulation of articulated objects such as doors and drawers. Our approach is based on rapidly-exploring random trees in combination with inverse kinematics and considers all required constraints during the search. Models of articulated objects hereby generate hand poses for sampled configurations along the trajectory of the object handle. We thoroughly evaluated our planning system and present experiments with a Nao humanoid opening a drawer, a door, and picking up an object. The experiments demonstrate the ability of our framework to generate solutions to complex planning problems and furthermore show that these plans can be reliably executed even on a low-cost humanoid platform.},

@article{minka_expectation_nodate,
	title = {Expectation {Propagation} for {Approximate} {Bayesian} {Inference}},
	abstract = {This paper presents a new deterministic approximation technique in Bayesian networks. This method, “Expectation Propagation,” uniﬁes two previous techniques: assumed-density ﬁltering, an extension of the Kalman ﬁlter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace’s method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efﬁcient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classiﬁers.},

	doi = {10.1109/70.508439},
	abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (/spl ap/150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds).},

	abstract = {Simulators have played a critical role in robotics research as tools for quick and efficient testing of new concepts, strategies, and algorithms. To date, most simulators have been restricted to 2D worlds, and few have matured to the point where they are both highly capable and easily adaptable. Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex worlds that would be encountered by the next generation of mobile robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of blackbox systems are all possible applications. Gazebo is developed in cooperation with the Player and Stage projects (Gerkey, B. P., et al., July 2003), (Gerkey, B. P., et al., May 2001), (Vaughan, R. T., et al., Oct. 2003), and is available from http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/ gazebo.html.},
